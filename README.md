# Dynamic-Cards

### Description:
>The purpose of this project is to practice manipulating Event Listeners. The code, when run, will create Cards in the form of Articles and in the footer is a Delete button that will remove the cards. The method I used to detect which card's button was pressed is controversial, because it re-assigns Event Listeners to Cards that already have it, every time that the Add Card button is pressed. I've found documentation on MDN that says the extra Event Handlers are discarded, but I should create a work-around anyway when I have more time.

### How to run:
```
http-server -p 8888
```

This will show at:
`http://localhost:8888`
